# Roger

Who is Roger..?

Roger is sample application using a few technologies I would like to try out:

- [x] Flux
- [x] Graphql
- [ ] Relay

Why the name? Because some smart guy wanted to abbreviated Relay, Graphql and React to RGR... Phonetically "Roger"...

## Roadmap/Todos

- [x] Build a simple app showing Links
- [x] Understand Flux and add those concepts for keeping state in react components up to date
- [x] Add mongoose for managing server object schema, will make graphql query schema easier to figure out
- [x] Add basic graphql end point for retreiving data
- [ ] Add Graphql mutations for adding & removing URL's
- [ ] Figure out what Relay is and inject it to the stack where appropriate

## Trying it out

Get development up and running:

1. npm install
1. In one window get node running with hot reload: `npm run start`
1. In another window get webpack running with hot reload: `./webpack -w -d`
1. Open `localhost:3100`
